      <h2>Llamas</h2>
      <p>these beautiful creatures have a life span of about 20 years.
         they are herbivors.The llama is thought to have originated in North America around 40 million years ago and the llama is believed to have then migrated to South America and Asia around 3 million years ago, before the American and Asian continents finally separated at Alaska. The llama is thought to have become extinct from North America during the ice age.
Today the llama is most commonly found in the Andes mountain region of South America where the llama was kept as a pack animal by the ancient Inca people. Llamas are used for meat, wool, skin and for transporting heavy loads (a little like donkeys).

The llama is thought to have evolved from the old world camel-like animals that inhabited the regions that is today the Middle East. Although the llama has many similarities to the camel, the most noticeable difference between the llama and the camel is that the llama does not have a hump on its back.

Llamas are very sociable animals and enjoy being with other llamas in a herd. The llama is also believed to be a particularly intelligent animal as llamas are commonly taught tasks which the llama picks up with only a few repetitions of the task.

Female llamas give birth to baby llamas (known as crias) standing up. The gestation period for a llama is between 11 and 12 months and the birth of the cria is usually over within half an hour. Baby llamas are generally standing up and attempting to walk within an hour of birth. Llama mating takes place throughout the year and baby llamas tend to be born in the morning when the weather is warm. This is believed to increase the fertility rate of the cria.


The llama is a herbivore and gets most of its nutrition from grass, leaves and young shoots. Llamas also do not have the same water retaining properties of their camel cousins, meaning that the llama must drink more often and llamas therefore prefer to be close to water.</p>

      <h2>alpacas</h2>
      <p> is a representative of camelids family, which emerged nearly 9-10 million years ago. Surprisingly, all the camel species (including llamas and camels) have originated on the North-American continent, but after severe climate change they moved to south. In particular, advancement of glacier from the North Pole into the continent forced this species to look for another habitat. One branch of camelids family found itself in South America (as one could guess, the second branch is in Africa nowadays). In particular, alpaca is much related to llamas and vicunas, which also "reside" in the area. Their final settlement on the south is dated 2 million years ago.
It is important to mention that South-American camelids might be divided into 2 groups: wild (guanaco and vicuna) and domesticated (llama and alpaca). The first records of domestication of both alpaca and related species are dated by Moche civilization period (6-7 thousand years ago), they are testified by multiple petroglyphic drawings (animals depiction, hunting, etc.) Further development of Incas Emperor on these lands preconditioned large distribution of alpacas, which was used in various fields of livelihood: as a pack animal, as a source of meat and fiber, and, of course, religious rites essential for Incas culture. Invasion of Spaniards reduced the number of alpacas’ population significantly. In modern society, domesticated alpacas have preserved their multifunctional nature; their fleece is sold on high prices on the world market due to peculiar attributes.

Distribution
The area of alpacas areal has not changed much since, and nowadays their habitat stretches along Andean highlands (Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina). In contrast to llamas and guanacos, alpaca species live on the altitude up to 5 thousand meters. People of Pre-Columbian era believed that there is no way to breed animals on low-hills; on the contrary, scientific investigations claim that before Spanish conquer camelids habitat included both plains and highlands. To date alpacas’ population counts nearly 3 million individuals, most of them live in Peruvian Andes.

Appearance and Feeding
Alpacas are 1 meter high with a body weight of 70 kg. Soft and long fleece (up to 15-20 cm on the sides) is a distinctive feature of this species, which appears to be a major value for local farmers. In correspondence to fiber diameter, alpaca’s fur is classified into four groups: Baby-Alpaca, Royal Alpaca, Very Soft Alpaca and Adult Alpaca.

Comparing to other ruminant animals, alpacas have some differences. For example, they can eat low-quality food (including all types of herbs), possessing a digestive apparatus with three compartments of the gastrointestinal tract (in contrast to common four). They gather forage much easier than other species thanks to a hare lip, which also might have influence on their low "demands" in food. Average life expectancy is 14 years, but some individuals manage to live more than 20 years.

Interesting facts
For a long time alpacas were considered descendants of llamas, but DNA testes pointed out their relation to vicunas. So, their Latin name is Vicuna pagos.Alpacas are also known for their ability to produce different sounds, such as whining (feeling danger), humming (when they are calm and pleased), clicking (being friendly), etc.


One more camelids species has been discovered lately - the result of alpaca and llama breeding. The specific feature of these animals is a disability to reproduce; therefore, they are usually used as pack animals.</h2>
      
      
      
      
      <h2>differences</h2>
      <p>Their ears: Alpaca ears have short spear-shaped ears while llamas have much longer, banana-shaped ears.
Their size: Alpacas generally weigh in at around 150 pounds while llamas can get as heavy as 400 pounds. At the shoulder, an average alpaca stands between 34 and 36 inches, while a llama generally ranges between 42 and 46 inches.
Their faces: Llamas have a longer face; an alpaca’s face is a bit more blunt, giving them a “smooshed in” look.
Their purpose: For more than 5,000 years alpacas have been bred for fiber (and in Peru for meat as well), while llamas have been bred for the same amount of time as pack animals and meat.
Their hair: The alpaca produces a much finer fiber than the llama. The alpaca also produces more fleece than its larger cousin and in a much greater variety of colors. Llamas also generally do not have as much hair on their head and face as alpacas do.
Their dispositions: Alpacas are very much herd animals, while llamas are more independent minded. Alpacas also tend to be a bit more skittish than llamas, which are often used as guard animals for alpacas, sheep, and other small livestock.
